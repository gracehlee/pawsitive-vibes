Set Up Day
- Our group successfully worked on our wireframe diagrams and discussed API endpoints.
- Our group successfully set up our GitLab repositories and downloaded our project base.

Today I worked on:

Understanding the various components of our project. I'm trying to understand how to implement a SQL database and table relations. I created the directory data, and inside created a Dockerfile.dev with commands to load the sql file to the Docker database when Docker runs. The dogs.sql file was also created to hold the SQL code that sets up the data types and table structures for our PostgreSQL database. I set up the basic table structure for the various endpoints we will be working with, but the Appointments table will largely be a work-in-progress depending on how we decide to structure the third party API data.
